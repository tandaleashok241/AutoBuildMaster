Additionally, the expansion of low-calorie and sugar-free food products is expected to drive market growth. Consumers are increasingly opting for artificial sweeteners as an alternative to traditional sugar, which is likely to continue supporting the market’s upward trajectory.</p><p>The demand for artificial sweeteners is also being propelled by changing lifestyles, an increase in the number of health-related initiatives, and government policies promoting healthier eating habits.
