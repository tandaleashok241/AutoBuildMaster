This growth is driven by the increasing prevalence of presbyopia, the rising geriatric population, and advancements in lens technologies. As the number of cataract surgeries continues to rise globally, demand for presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses is expected to increase steadily. Factors such as enhanced product offerings, improving patient awareness, and rising disposable incomes, particularly in developing countries, contribute to this growth trajectory.</p><p>In addition, the growing adoption of multifocal and accommodating PCIOLs, which offer better visual outcomes for patients, is expected to drive further demand in the coming years. These lenses are particularly in demand in markets such as North America and Europe, where healthcare infrastructure and awareness are more advanced. However, the market is also seeing strong growth in emerging regions, driven by greater access to advanced ophthalmic surgeries and technological innovations in lens designs, which provide improved functionality and comfort for patients.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Request PDF Sample Copy of Report: (Including Full TOC, List of Tables &amp; Figures, Chart)&nbsp;@&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/344940/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=259" target="_blank">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/344940/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=259</a></strong></strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class="">Prescale Film Market&nbsp;Overview and Projection:</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation technique, the Prescale Film Market research study provides a comprehensive analysis of multiple market segments, including application, type, and location.
